# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim - My Neovim Configuration

## Introduction
This repository contains my personal Neovim configuration based on [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim). It is a fully featured setup that I use for development, with everything pre-configured, including GitHub Copilot and other essential tools.

## Features
- ðŸ›  **LazyVim** as the base configuration
- ðŸ§  **GitHub Copilot** for AI-powered coding assistance
- ðŸš€ **Optimized for development** with LSP, treesitter, and useful plugins
- ðŸ“¦ **Pre-configured plugins** for productivity and efficiency
- ðŸŽ¨ **Beautiful and clean UI** with modern themes

## Installation
To use this configuration, clone the repository into your Neovim configuration directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/anshux1/LazyVim ~/.config/nvim
```

Then, open Neovim and let LazyVim install the required plugins automatically:

```sh
nvim
```

## Usage
Once installed, you can start using LazyVim with your favorite shortcuts and features. Some key bindings and commands include:

- `<leader> f f` - Find files
- `<leader> g g` - Open Git interface
- `<leader> c a` - Apply code actions
- `<leader> d` - Show diagnostics
- And many more...

## Customization
You can modify the configuration files in `~/.config/nvim/lua` to customize LazyVim to your liking. Add or remove plugins, adjust settings, and tweak the UI as needed.
